# Mass_layoffs

## The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection 

We chose mass layoffs since during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies are resorting to letting their employees go as a means of cutting costs and staying afloat at an alarming rate. 

## A description of the data 

Tracking the tech layoffs reported on the following platforms:

Bloomberg
San Francisco Business Times
TechCrunch
The New York Times
The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. 11 March 2020 to present (28th February 2023).
Some data such as the sources, list of employees laid off and date of addition has been omitted here and the complete data can be found on Layoffs.fyi.
