# Mass_layoffs

current view of our data.  we may have some issues with the industry column.  We have a lot of 
industries listed which is what we were thinking about trying to predict in the future, what industry
may be the next casuality for a mass layoff.  But, we have a lot of them listed, not sure how to 
go about grouping them.  Will need further analysis. 

Updated the industry column and using the standard set to classify industry called
the Global Industry Classification Standard.  This allowed us to combine our
industries in our original data set from over 30 categories to now just eleven.
