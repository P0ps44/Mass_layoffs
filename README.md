# Mass_layoffs

current view of our data.  we may have some issues with the industry column.  We have a lot of 
industries listed which is what we were thinking about trying to predict in the future, what industry
may be the next casuality for a mass layoff.  But, we have a lot of them listed, not sure how to 
go about grouping them.  Will need further analysis.
