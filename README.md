# Mass_layoffs

## The selected topic and the reasoning for that selection 

We chose mass layoffs starting from the COVID-19 pandemic(March 2020). During that time, many companies were resorting to letting their employees go as a means of cutting costs and staying afloat at an alarming rate. 

## A description of the data 

Tracking the industry layoffs reported on the following platforms:

* Bloomberg
* San Francisco Business Times
* TechCrunch
* The New York Times

The data availability is from when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic i.e. 11 March 2020 to present as of April 7th 2023. 
Some data such as the sources, list of employees laid off and date of addition has been omitted here and the complete data can be found on [Layoffs-2022](https://layoffs.fyi/)
